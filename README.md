# A project that combined a Node backend with a React front end

### What does it do
- The backend reads data from a json file, calculates averages for several indicators and exposes 2 endpoints with the results written as json

- The frontend makes ajax requests to the endpoints to get the data, displays the results and filters the data by category and most recent.

### How to play with it

```
git clone https://github.com/emilMircea/node-react-project.git

# go in the backend folder
yarn && yarn start

# go in the frontend folder
yarn && yarn start
```
Now that you have both servers running go to localhost:3001 to see the app in action.
